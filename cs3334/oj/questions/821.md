### Description
The live on Christmas Eve was a huge success. Several years later, the rise of new cities reshapes the road network. Now it is in the form of a **general tree** instead of a binary tree.

The increasing population leads to economic prosperity as well as heavy traffic load. Today, it may take more than $1$ unit time to travel from one city to another city directly connected by a road because of the frequent traffic jam.

As a girl loving travel, Kyaru would like to know the longest time it may take to travel if she freely chooses a departure and a destination. You may assume that Kyaru always considers the shortest way only.

### Input

The first line contains an integer $n$ , indicating the number of cities.

In each of the following $n-1$ lines there're three integers $u,v,w$, separated by spaces, denoting a road connecting the city $u,v$, and it will take $w$ units time to go through it.

It is guaranteed that the road network forms a tree.

### Output
One integer, indicating the longest traveling time Kyaru could find.
