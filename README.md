## DMCA Takedown Response
> Sorry guys, the repo has downtime :(

About [2024-10-30-city-university-of-hong-kong.md
](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2024/10/2024-10-30-city-university-of-hong-kong.md).
I received a DMCA report regarding the content (./cs2312/) of my repository.

Below is my response to file a DMCA counter-notice. I believe the Github has already made their request public, and I believe the response from the defense should also be public.

**Are you the owner of the content that has been disabled, or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf?**

Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

According to CityU’s "UNIVERSITY POLICY ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY," specifically Clause 5.9.8 Student Work, "Subject to Clauses 5.9.5 and 5.9.6, copyright in all original work produced by students in the course of or for the purposes of their studies, scholarship, or research with or at the University shall be owned by the students concerned. Examples of student work include dissertations, theses, films, computer programs, and research papers." Under this policy, I hold the copyright to the code I created as part of my coursework, as it constitutes my original work developed independently.

If the reporter can provide proof that they own the source code I wrote, I will evaluate whether deletion or other action is appropriate. If copyright ownership is proven, I am willing to remove it.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The DMCA takedown led to the removal of my entire repository at this URL: https://github.com/jerrykhh/cityu/tree/main/cs2312. The repository included several files that reflect my original solutions to course assignments.

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

I believe the report was filed in error, and I’d like to address several points that support this belief:
Original Content: The code provided in the repository is my own original work, created independently to solve coursework assignments. The reporter's statement that “over 70% of the contents were provided by [private] and without any changes by the student” is incorrect; I ask that the reporter provide evidence to support their claim if they believe otherwise.

Commit History for Proof of Authorship: I have an earlier repository with the original source code, including commit history from around four years ago, located at https://github.com/jerrykhh/CS2312/commits/master. This history clearly shows my authorship and the code’s originality. Since this code was posted years ago, I also question why the reporter is making this claim now.

Previous Email & Request Context: Prior to this DMCA, I received an email request from someone teaching this course, asking someone to remove the solutions from my GitHub but the name is not mine so I ignored it. However, this email did not include any assertion of copyright ownership over my code. From my understanding, this request may have been based on a desire to prevent students from copying solutions instead of creating their own work, rather than any legitimate copyright claim. It’s important to note that my code, is only my own solutions.

Email:
```
Dear [incorrect name],

As I am still teaching this course, may I request you remove the solutions of CS2312 questions, exercises and assignments from your github?

https://github.com/jerrykhh/cityu/commit/a3995ff1a0b1e0a9c08f361aa0bff0e9897a6938

https://github.com/jerrykhh/cityu/tree/main/cs2312


Would you take action as soon as possible.

Best regards,

If the reporter can provide legitimate proof that they own the source code I wrote, I will evaluate whether deletion or other action is appropriate. If copyright ownership is proven, I am willing to remove it.

I am aware that the practice of buying and selling source code is widespread in the school community. Not everyone has the financial means to purchase these materials, yet students who do so can significantly boost their grades. This creates an unfair advantage over those who cannot afford to buy these resources. For this reason, I chose to make my own work and resources public in an effort to bring a bit more fairness to the situation.

While I know I cannot make the world completely fair, I want to ensure that I am not contributing to its unfairness. I believe learning should be about mutual sharing and collaboration, not a transaction where students buy solutions to earn higher grades without truly engaging with the knowledge. To address this issue effectively, I would suggest that the complainant consider regularly updating course materials and assignments. This would help prevent situations where certain students rely on past solutions to excel, rather than remove the course solution on the Internet and then solve the problem.

I believe this is the attitude educators should uphold. Teaching should foster genuine understanding and curiosity, creating an environment where students are encouraged to learn through their own efforts rather than relying on purchased solutions.

Thanks
