## Solution

### Q1

Bob should win in the 3 following rounds to get the pot. Otherwise, he loses. So, the ratio for Bob is (1/2)3=1/8; for Alice is 7/8.

### Q2

Mean is $1\times 0.3 + 2\times 0.2 + 3\times 0.5 = 2.2$;

Variance is $(1-2.2)^2\times 0.3 + (2-2.2)^2\times 0.2+(3-2.2)^2\times 0.5 = 0.76$

### Q3

$P(AB)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cup B) = 0.2$

### Q4

- I do not lose my data as at least one hard-disk works. 
$1-(0.6\%\times0.6\%)=0.999964$

- Only one disk fails.
$2\times0.6\%\times(1-0.6\%)=0.011928$

### Q5
$(1/6)\times(1/6)+2\times(1/6)\times(1/6)+2\times(1/6)\times(1/6)+(1/6)\times(1/6)=1/6$

### Q6

### Q13

the total number of possible events: $6^3$
consider all possible events (regardless of permutations) that satisfy the conditions: {1,2,3}, {1,2,4}, {1,2,5}, {1,2,6}, {1,3,4}, {1,3,5}, {1,3,6}, {1,4,5}, {2,3,4}, {2,3,5}. For each of them, there are $P_{3}^{3}$ permutations. Therefore, the probability is $10\times P_{3}^{3} / 6^3 = 5/18$

### Q14

total possible events = $C_{2}^{52}$; number of ways to pick two cards same rank: $C_{13}^{1}C_{4}^{2}$ The probability is $C_{13}^{1}C_{4}^{2}/C_{52}^2=1/17$

### Q15

(a) if two events are independent, $P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B)=0.2\times0.1=0.02$ then $P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)=0.2+0.1-0.02=0.28$

(b) if two events are mutually exclusive, $P(A\cap B)= 0, P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)=0.3$

### Q16

the probability that one win for each game is  $(1-3/3^2)/2=1/3$ In order to win, Tom will have to win in the first two games or win one of the first two games plus the last game. Each game is independent, so the probability that Tom wins in the first two games is $C_{2}^2(1/3)^2=1/9$ the probability that Tom wins one of the first two games plus the last game: $(C_{2}^1(1/3)^1(1/3)^1)\times 1/3 = 4/27$. The probability of Tom being the winner is the sum of the two, $1/9+4/27=7/27$

### Q17

(a) Since the random variables X and Y are independent, $V(X-2Y)= V(X)+V(2Y) = V(X)+4\times V(Y) = 10/3$

(b) Z can take 1,2,3, X+Z can take 2,3,4,5,6

$P(X+Z=2)=P(X=1,Z=1)=P(X=1,Y=1)=P(X=1)P(Y=1)=(1/3)\times (1/3)=1/9$

$P(X+Z=3)=P(X=1,Z=2)=P(X=1,Y=2)=(1/3)\times (1/3)=1/9$

$P(X+Z=4)=P(X=2,Z=2)+P(X=1,Z=3)=P(X=2,Y=1)+P(X=2,Y=2)+P(X=1,Y=3)=1/3$

$P(X+Z=5)=P(X=2,Z=3)=P(X=2,Y=3)=1/9$

$P(X+Z=6)=P(X=3,Z=3) = P(X=3,Y=1)+P(X=3,Y=2)+P(X=3,Y=3)=1/3$

$E(X+Z)= 2√óP(X+Z=2)+3\times P(X+Z=3)+4\times P(X+Z=4)+5\times P(X+Z=5)+6\times P(X+Z=6)=40/9$

$V(X+Z)=1/9\times (2-40/9)^2+1/9\times(3-40/9)^2+1/3\times(4-40/9)^2+1/9\times(5-40/9)\times+1/3\times(6-40/9)^2=146/81$

### Q18

Since $P(AB)=P(A)P(B)=1/6$, $P(B)=1/6\times 1/P(A)$

Since $P(AB)=P(A)P(B)=(1-P(A)) (1-P(B)) = 1-P(A)-P(B)+P(A)P(B)=1-P(A\cup B)=1/3$,

We have $P(A\cup B)=1-1/3=2/3=P(A)+P(B)-P(AB)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A)P(B)$, $P(A)+1/6\times (1/P(A))-P(A)\times 1/6\times 1/P(A)=2/3$

Solve this equation, $A=1/3$ or $A=1/2$

### Q19
Since Tom will toss a coin 3 or 4 or 5 times, the space of the random variable X is

$R_{X}={3,4,5}$

```
P(X=3) = P(at least one head) = 1 - P(no heads in first 3 times) = 1 - (P(tail in each try))^3 = 1 - (1/2)^3 = 7/8
P(X=4) = P(3 tails and 1 head in last try) = (1/2)(1/2)^3  = 1/16
P(X=5) = P(4 tails and 1 head in last try) = P(5 tails in 5 tries) = (1/2)^5 +(1/2)(1/2)^4 = 1/16
Hence, the expected value of the random variable is 
E(X) = 3 P(X=3) + 4 P(X=4) + 5 P(X=5) = 3(7/8)+4(1/16)+5(1/16) = 51/16 
```

### Q20
(a) 

$E(X)=1(1/6)+2(1/6)+3(1/6)+4(1/6)+5(1/6)+6(1/6)=7/2$

$Var(X)=((1-7/2)^2(2-7/2)^2+(3-7/2)^2+(4-7/2)^2+(5-7/2)^2+(6-7/2)^2)\times (1/6)=25/12$

$SD(X)=\sqrt{Var(Y)}=\sqrt{35/12}$

(b)

$E(Y)=10\times E(X)=35$

$Var(Y) = 10\times Var(X)=175/6$

$SD(Y) = \sqrt{Var(Y)} = \sqrt{175/6}$

(c)

$Var(X) = E(X^2)-(E(X))^2$, so $E(X^{2})=35/12+(7/2)^2=91/6$

$E(3X+2) = 3\times E(X)+2=25/2$

$E((Y+2)^2)=E(Y^2)+4E(Y)+4=175/6+(35)^2+4\times 35+4=8389/6$

$Var(-X)=(-1)^2\times Var(X)=35/12$

$SD(2Y)=\sqrt{Var(2Y)}=\sqrt{2^2Var(Y)}=\sqrt{350/3}$

### Q21

The circuit work can be represented as $E_1\cap[(E_2\cap E_3)\cup(E_4\cap (E_5\cup E_6))]\cap E_7$

$P(E_2\cap E_3)=0.9\times 0.9=0.81$

$P(E_4\cap (E_5\cup E_6))=0.8\times (1-(1-0.8)\times (1-0.8))=0.768$

Therefore, P(function well) = $0.95\times (1-(1-0.81)\times (1-0.768))*0.95=0.8627$
